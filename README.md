# Distortion-pedal
Distortion pedal, designed in KiCAD, manufactured by JLCPCB.
Based on circuit on the circuit presented under this link: https://www.wamplerpedals.com/blog/lifestyle-hobby/2024/08/how-to-design-a-basic-distortion-pedal-circuit/
I prototyped the circuit on the breadboard, tested the tone and designed the PCB, V1 had some issues, like isolated islands on the PCB, and didn't work properly. Right now I'm waiting for delivery of the newest version.
