# Distortion-pedal

## Project type:
Portfolio

## Status:
Completed, may add case and potentiometer knobs in the future

## Description
Distortion pedal, designed in KiCAD, manufactured by JLCPCB.
Based on circuit on the circuit presented under this link: https://www.wamplerpedals.com/blog/lifestyle-hobby/2024/08/how-to-design-a-basic-distortion-pedal-circuit/
Distortion pedals are usually based on "clipping" the sound with diodes, for this project I use red LEDs.
The circuit was at first prototyped on the breadboard and tested for its sound.
PCB was desinged, ordered from JLCPCB and soldered, effect is as below.
